# File Sort & Duplicate Cleaner

This is a small Python script that cleans up messy folders.  
It organises files into simple folders and removes duplicate files to save space.

## What problem it solves

- Downloads or Desktop folder becomes full of random files  
- Hard to find important documents  
- Same file is saved many times and storage gets wasted

## What this script does

- Sorts files into folders (Documents, Images, Videos, Others etc.)  
- Finds duplicate files and removes them (or moves to a separate folder)  
- Works on any folder you choose

1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed.  
2. Download this project (Code → Download ZIP) and extract it.  
3. Open `file_sort_duplicate_cleaner.py`.
