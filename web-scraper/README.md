# Simple Web Scraper

This Python script collects useful data from web pages automatically.

Instead of copying text or tables by hand, it can fetch the information and save it for you.

## What it can do

- Send a request to a web page
- Extract specific data (like titles, prices, or links)
- Save the data into a CSV or text file for later use

## How to use

1. Open the script and update the target URL and data you want to collect.  
2. Run the script with Python.  
3. Check the output file (CSV or text) created by the script.
