## How to use

1. Put your CSV file in the same folder as this script.  
2. Open the script and update the file path if needed.  
3. Run the script with Python.  
4. A new cleaned CSV file will be created.

## When it is useful

- Cleaning exported data from websites or tools  
- Preparing files before sending to clients or uploading to dashboards
