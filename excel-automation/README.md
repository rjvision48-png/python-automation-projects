## What this folder contains

This folder has small Python scripts that help with Excel and CSV files.  
All scripts are for office work like cleaning data, joining columns and making simple reports.

- `csv_clean.py` – cleans messy CSV/Excel files  
  Removes empty rows, trims extra spaces and fixes basic formatting so the file is ready to use.

- `column_merge.py` – joins multiple columns into one  
  Useful when first name, last name or address are in different columns and you want them together.

- `excel_automation.py` – does simple bulk updates in Excel  
  Can apply the same change (for example add text, update a column) to many rows at once.

- `report_generator.py` – creates a basic summary report from your data  
  Reads your data and saves a small summary (totals, counts or simple stats) into a new file.
