## What this folder contains

This folder has tools for cleaning and organising files on your computer.  
They are useful for messy Downloads, Desktop or project folders.

- `file_sort_duplicate.py` – sorts files into folders and finds duplicates  
  Groups files by type (documents, images, videos, etc.) and lists duplicate files that you can remove.

- `bulk_rename.py` – renames many files in one go  
  Changes file names using a pattern (for example add date, add prefix, fix spelling) instead of renaming by hand.

- `folder_organiser.py` – organises files into neat folders automatically  
  Moves files into simple folders so it is easier to find things later.
